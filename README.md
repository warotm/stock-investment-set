*SET = Stock Exchange of Thailand*

The main idea is from `What Works on Wall Street` by James O'Shaughnessy

## Files

* `data_scapper.ipynb` is used to scrap the most official updated data from https://www.set.or.th/

* `portfolio_rebalancer.ipynb` is used to calculate features of each stock, rank them according to Value-Composite-Damodaran and Relative-Price-Strength, which is my current investment strategy, and create rebalancing plan for my portfolio.
